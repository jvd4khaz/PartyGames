# One Night Ultimate Werewolf
## Complete Rules and Role Reference

### Game Overview

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast-paced social deduction game for 3-10 players. The game takes place over a single night and day phase. Players are assigned secret roles, and during the night phase, roles perform special actions that may swap cards or reveal information. During the day phase, players discuss and vote to eliminate one player. The game ends immediately after voting, with different teams winning based on who was eliminated.

**Key Features:**

- Single round gameplay (approximately 10 minutes)
- Roles can be swapped during the night phase
- Players may not know their final role until the end
- Fast-paced discussion and deduction

### Objective

- **Villagers:** Eliminate at least one Werewolf to win
- **Werewolves:** Avoid elimination to win
- **Tanner:** Get eliminated to win (Villagers and Werewolves lose)

### Setup

1. **Select Roles:** Choose role cards equal to the number of players plus 3. For example:
   - 5 players = 8 role cards total
   - 7 players = 10 role cards total

2. **Shuffle and Deal:** Shuffle all selected role cards and deal one face down to each player. Place the remaining 3 cards face down in the center of the table.

3. **View Roles:** Each player secretly looks at their role card and places it face down in front of them. Players should memorize their role.

4. **Designate Announcer:** One player acts as the Announcer (or use the companion app) to guide the night phase.

### Night Phase

All players close their eyes. The Announcer calls out roles in the following order. When a role is called, players with that role open their eyes, perform their action, then close their eyes again.

**Night Phase Order:**

1. **Doppelgänger**
2. **Werewolves**
3. **Minion**
4. **Masons**
5. **Seer**
6. **Robber**
7. **Troublemaker**
8. **Drunk**
9. **Insomniac**

**Important:** Roles that do not wake during the night phase: Villager, Hunter, Tanner.

### Day Phase

1. **All players open their eyes.**

2. **Discussion Phase:** Players discuss what happened during the night. Players may share information, make accusations, or strategize. There is no time limit, but the Announcer may impose one.

3. **Voting Phase:** After discussion, all players simultaneously point to the player they want to eliminate. The player(s) with the most votes is eliminated.

4. **Hunter Ability:** If the Hunter is eliminated, they immediately point to another player, who is also eliminated.

5. **Game Resolution:** Check win conditions based on who was eliminated.

### Win Conditions

- **Villagers Win:** If at least one Werewolf is eliminated (regardless of who else was eliminated).

- **Werewolves Win:** If no Werewolves are eliminated (even if other players were eliminated).

- **Tanner Wins:** If the Tanner is eliminated, the Tanner wins and both Villagers and Werewolves lose.

**Note:** If multiple teams would win, Villagers take priority over Werewolves, but Tanner wins override everything.

### Roles

#### Doppelgänger

**Team:** Variable (depends on copied role)

**Night Action:** Look at another player's card. You become that role and immediately perform that role's night action (if it has one).

#### Card Swapping Order

After all swaps, Insomniac looks at their final card.

#### Information Timing

- Seer sees cards at the time of their action (before swaps)
- Werewolf sees center cards at the time of their action (before swaps)
- Insomniac sees their card after all swaps
- Robber sees their new card immediately after swapping

### Strategy Tips

**For Villagers:**

- Share information carefully
- Be aware your card may have been swapped
- Trust confirmed information from Seer or Insomniac
- Watch for contradictions in claims

**For Werewolves:**

- Blend in with Villagers
- Create confusion about who was swapped
- Protect each other subtly
- Use information from center cards if available

**For Tanner:**

- Act suspiciously early
- Claim to be a Werewolf
- Try to get eliminated without being too obvious

**For Special Roles:**

- Seer: Verify claims with your information
- Robber: Choose targets that help your team
- Troublemaker: Create strategic confusion
- Insomniac: Use your confirmed role information

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Revealing too much information:** Be careful about what you share during discussion

2. **Forgetting card swaps:** Remember that roles can change during the night

3. **Ignoring the Tanner:** The Tanner can win if eliminated, changing win conditions

4. **Not using Hunter ability:** If Hunter is eliminated, they must eliminate another player

5. **Misunderstanding Doppelgänger:** The Doppelgänger's team depends on what they copy
