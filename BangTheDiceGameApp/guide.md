Bang! Dice

Goal:

Sheriff: must eliminate the Outlaws and the Renegade(s);
Deputies: must keep the Sheriff alive and help him eliminate the Outlaws and Renegade(s);
Outlaws: must eliminate the Sheriff;
Renegade: must eliminate all other players other than the Sheriff, and eliminate the Sheriff last. If (in an 8
player game) two renegades end up left together having killed the Sheriff, the Outlaws win.
If none of the win conditions have been triggered and everyone is dead, the Outlaws win.
Setup:

Take as many roles as the number of players, divided as follows (put the rest back in the box): Shuffle the
roles and deal one, face down, to each player.
a. 4 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws;
b. 5 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws, 1 Deputy;
c. 6 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 1 Deputy;
d. 7 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputies;
e. 8 players: 1 Sheriff, 2 Renegades, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputies.
The Sheriff reveals himself by turning his card face up. All other players look at their role but must keep it
secret.
Shuffle the characters and give one face up to each player (put the rest back in the box). Each player now
announces the name of his character and reads his ability aloud.
Each player takes a number of bullets (life points) as shown on his character card. The Sheriff plays the
game with two additional bullets. Keep any remaining bullets in a pile in the middle of the table.
Keep the summary cards handy.
Place the nine arrows in a pile in the middle of the table.
The Sheriff takes the five dice and starts the game.
Gameplay:
The game is played in turns, in clockwise order. On your turn, you will:

Roll all five dice (NOTE!):
o Any dynamite rolled is locked for the whole roll phase, and cannot be re-rolled.
o Arrows must be resolved IMMEDIATELY after each roll. Re-rolls may trigger more arrows!
You may then choose to keep the dice or re-roll some or all of them up to two times. If you roll a third time,
you may also re-roll any dice you didn’t choose to re-roll on your second roll. You must accept the third roll.
When you are satisfied with your dice roll (or you’re out of re-rolls), resolve the dice results in the order
specified below.
Your turn is over and play passes to the player on your left.
The Dice
The dice show six different symbols. You must apply all the dice results in the following order. You cannot pass
on a rolled die: you must use them all!

1. Indian arrow: You must resolve this die immediately when rolled , not at the end of your turn. Take one
arrow token per arrow rolled and keep it in front of you. You may roll this die again if you have re-rolls left.
If you take the last arrow, the Indians attack and each player loses one life point for each arrow in front of
him. After the attack, all players discard their arrows, and you resume your turn. If you have still more
arrows from your other dice, you receive these now.

Dynamite: This die cannot be re-rolled! If you roll three or more Dynamites, you lose 1 life point.
ERRATA: If you die from the dynamite, your turn ends immediately, go to Elimination (see below). If you
survive the dynamite, you may complete your turn.
Bulls Eyes : All Bulls Eye dice are resolved simultaneously, after all targets have been allocated (so target
positions do not shift due to eliminations on a player’s turn). You may allocate ‘overkill’ shots to players
who already died this player turn to avoid shooting friendly targets. All the Eliminated players reveal their
identities simultaneously after all shots are resolved. In subsequent turns, when counting distance to
players do not count eliminated players.
a. Bull’s Eye “1”: Choose the player next to you on your left or right. That player loses one life
point.
b. Bull’s Eye “2”: Choose the player exactly two places to your left or right. That player loses one
life point. If there are only two or three players left in the game, treat this as a Bull’s Eye “1”.
Beer: Choose any player: he gains one life point. You may choose yourself. You can never have more life
points than the number you had at the beginning of the game. If you choose a player with his maximum life
points, this result is wasted.
Gatling: If you roll three or more Gatlings you activate the Gatling Gun, and each of the other players loses
one life point. Also, you discard all of your arrows.
Running Out of Life Points—A Player Is Eliminated
Immediately when you lose your last life point, you are out of the game. Show your role to all players and discard all
your arrows. If you are eliminated, you do not act in the game anymore. But, if your team partners win, you win too!

Game End:
The game ends immediately if:
a) The Sheriff is eliminated: If a Renegade is the only one alive , he wins. Otherwise, all Outlaws win as a team.
b) All the Outlaws and Renegades are eliminated : The Sheriff and all Deputies win as a team.

Player Powers:

BART CASSIDY (8) You may take an arrow instead of losing a life point (except to Indians or Dynamite).
You cannot use this ability if you lose a life point to Indian or Dynamite, only for Bulls Eyes, or Gatling Guns. You
may not use this ability to take the last arrow remaining in the pile. If you are shot by Slab the Killer, you can take two
arrows to avoid losing life from Slab the Killer’s double shot.

BLACK JACK (8) You may re-roll dynamite (not if you roll three or more!).
i.e. dynamite dice are not locked after rolling. If you only have one or two of them, when you make your next re-roll
they can be included. This character does not entitle you to extra re-rolls, just prevents dice locking! If you roll three
or more Dynamite at once (or in total if you didn’t re-roll them), follow the usual rules for dynamite exploding.

CALAMITY JANET (8) You can use 1 Bulls-Eyes as 2 Bulls Eyes and vice-versa.

EL GRINGO (7) When a player makes you lose one or more life points, he must take an arrow.
Life points lost to Indians or Dynamite are not affected. i.e. if they hit you with several Bulls Eyes simultaneously, they
only take one arrow. If El Gringo is shot with the Gatling, the Gatling holding player loses his existing arrows
BEFORE he has to take El Gringo’s arrow.

JESSE JONES (9) If you have four life points or less, you gain two if you use Beer for yourself.
For example, if you have four life points and use two beers, you get four life points.

JOURDONNAIS (7) You never lose more than one life point to Indians.
Normally you would lose 1 life point per arrow. You just lose 1 life point irrespective of the number of arrows.

KIT CARLSON (7) For each Gatling dice, you may discard one arrow from any player.
You apply this ability after you have finished rolling all dice. You may choose to discard your own arrows. If you roll
three Gatling Dice, you discard all your own arrows, plus three from any player(s) (of course, you still deal one
damage to each other player).

LUCKY DUKE (8) You may make one extra re-roll.
You may roll the dice a total of four times on your turn.

PAUL REGRET (9) You never lose life points to the Gatling Gun.

PEDRO RAMIREZ (8) Each time you lose a life point, you may discard one of your arrows.
You still lose the life point when you use this ability. 1 arrow per 1 life, e.g. for Slab’s double shot.

ROSE DOOLAN (9) You may use 1 or 2-Bulls Eyes for players sitting one place further.
With you may hit a player sitting up to two places away, and with you may hit a player sitting two or three places
away. In a 4-player game, rose could use a 2-Bulls Eye shot to hit a player 3 places round the table, who is actually
only 1 place in the other direction.

SID KETCHUM (8) At the beginning of your turn, any player of your choice gains one life point.
You may also choose yourself.

SLAB THE KILLER (8) Once per turn, you can use a Beer to double a 1 - or 2 - Bullseye.
The dice you double takes two life points away from the same player (you can’t choose two different players). The
beer is consumed in doubling the effect, and does not provide life points as well.

SUZY LAFAYETTE (8) If you didn’t roll any 1 - or 2 - Bulls Eyes, you gain two life points.
This only applies at the end of your turn, not during your re-rolls.

VULTURE SAM (9) Each time another player is eliminated, you gain two life points.
If you die at the same time as any other players, you do not receive the life points, and cannot be resurrected.

WILLY THE KID (8) You only need two Gatling Dice to use the Gatling Gun.
You can activate the Gatling Gun only once per turn, even if you roll more than two results.
